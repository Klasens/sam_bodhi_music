      "paragraph": "True, accurate, complete, Sam Bodhi's Jazz slices down the middle, through the sides and into the openings, highlighting the foundations of a genre that won't fit so easily into the boxes of music. Bill Hickey, known as Sam Bodhi, was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and has music spanning across multiple continents. Traditionally a blues player, Bodhi found his roots deep inside Chicago's streets. He attended Northeastern Illinois University studying music theory and guitar, only after leaving school did he discover his true instrument, the piano."

      "paragraph": "To say his repertoire is eclectic sells it short as Sam Bodhi has followed a long path of self-taught blues and jazz. After leaving Chicago, he became involved in the Los Angeles music scene where he lived and performed blues up the streets of Sunset and Santa Monica Blvd in clubs such as the Troubadour. It wasn't until leaving L.A. that Sam Bodhi fell further into his passion for jazz. In New Orleans, Sam Bodhi expanded his roots as a performer developing a full jazz repertoire. Bodhi's style moves from traditional to highly harmonic with runs described as 'out there' and tastefully dissonant. Playing across the U.S. for multiple decades, Bodhi most recently returned to Green Bay, WI, spreading waves of jazz to whichever clubs he visits."
