      "paragraph": "True, accurate, complete, Sam Bodhi's Jazz slices down the middle, through the sides and into the openings, highlighting the foundations of a genre that won't fit so easily into the boxes of music. Bill Hickey, known as Sam Bodhi, was born in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and has music spanning across multiple continents. Traditionally a blues player, Bodhi found his roots deep inside Chicago's streets. He attended Northeastern Illinois University studying music theory and guitar, only after leaving school did he discover his true instrument, the piano."
