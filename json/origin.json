      "paragraph": "The enlightened mind knows all things everywhere. Translated literally, Anuttara Samyak Sambodhi is the unexcelled, right, all-pervading way. Sam Bodhi, in its musical form connects the free flowing thought of man while separating the mundane from the real. It unhinders the spirit giving us a chance to experience something beyond ourselves for at least a few minutes. Ultimately,the self always strives for enlightenment, and music gives us a brief glimpse into a place where we can see that path."
